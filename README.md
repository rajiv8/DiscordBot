## Step -1: Creating the bot application

<h5>First we need to visit the developer website of discord for creating our bot application,
<a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">discord.com/developers/applications</a></h5>
<h5>The page would look somethong like this :</h5>

<h5>After we click on "New Application" on the above right corner of that page. A window pop ups asking your bot name you would like to keep.</br>
Just enter the name of the bot you would like to give and hit create button.</h5>

<h5>So, After we create our bot , we land to a page where we can do many settings for our bot.</h5>

<h5>Then we go to the "bot" setiings on the left side of the page , since we need to create our bot first.
After clicking on bot settings we comes on a page, where there is option of "Add Bot" above the right corner, we need to click on that and hit the "Yes do it" button when appears.
Now your bot has been create and attached to the application.Now you need to copy the token, it will be used in our coding.(But not yet Attached to the discord server)
